        Calian is responsible for flying the Canadian Space Agency's (CSA) satellites and 
        is located at the <a id = "linx", href="https://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/multimedia/search/image/809">John H. Chapman Space Centre</a>.
        As the first student hired by Calian, I was exposed to many projects and tasked with the training of future students. I paved the path for
        future collaborations between Calian and <a id="linx", href="asat.html">AlbertaSat</a>. This relationship is still developing and Calian hopes to
        start developing its operations technology for <a id = "linx", href="https://www.nasa.gov/what-are-smallsats-and-cubesats/#:~:text=What%20are%20CubeSats%3F,%2C%206%2C%20and%20even%2012U.">CubeSat</a> teams across 
        the country.

        My role with Calian mainly involved developing data managment systems for satellite telemetry as well as anamoly detection tools. 
        I developed APIs using the Flask framework in python to more easily search for relevant information and highlight abnormal values and build reports.
        This made a job that usually takes hours be completed perfectly in less than a minute.

        Within my time at the CSA I had the chance to work on important satellite monitoring tasks on Canada's biggest space missions, such as SciSat, NEOSat, and the RADARSAT missions. 
        I worked closely on interdisiplanary teams from members across a wide variety of backgrounds. I presented to government and private interested parties, and was given responsibilties that
        full time employees would take on. I was known as a reliable and fast worker, who found and took on projects out of my own volition. I found the work interested and was eager to add my part to 
        the growing space industry in Canada.
