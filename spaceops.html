        During my CO-OP at Calian with the Canadian Space Agency I was exposed to the software that monitors the telemetry
        on Canada's largest satellite missions. This software read health and safety data and presented it in a clear manner, as well 
        as allowed a user to upload commands in an easy and timely manner. This technology is something that small scale satellite groups lack
        as they often cannot afford the software or need something more streamlined for its needs. As a product of these issues, myself
        and a team of two other students aim to build a telemetry reading and command uploading software that is open source and freely available
        to small teams in order to improve their operations. Our abstract was submitted to the SpaceOps conference and was accepted, thus we will be presenting
        our product in this years SpaceOps Conference.
        <a id = "linx", href="https://www.spaceops.org">SpaceOps</a> is an international aerospace conference hosted in Montreal.
         It is a space where seasoned professionals as well as young talent share innovative technology and research.

        This project includes three main deliverables; a research paper presenting the lessons learned and the software tool, the software tool itself, 
        and integration into the <a id = "linx", href="asat.html">AlbertaSat</a> operations. This project has allowed me to further grow my
        project managment, software development, teamwork, and presentation skills.

        The code stack for this will include a python backend and use django framework to integrate with a javascript frontend.
        The tool will integrate with satellite radio reception attennas and will process and interpret telemetry packets. All
        team members are responsible for development on all fronts.
